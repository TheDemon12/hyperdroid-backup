Description: Big Pix is a pretty standard blogging theme, albeit with a real focus on large format images on the home page and archive pages. The post pages also use a full sized featured image, not unlike the style popularised by Medium. You can easily upload your own logo and favicon, or change the default colour scheme to anything you like. It is also has dedicated widget areas for pages, posts, archive pages and the home page so you have a great deal of flexibility over the content on these page types. And of course it is fully responsive.
